    <div id="VenusCard" class="info-card">
        <h3>Venus</h3>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar
            size,
            mass, and proximity to the Sun.</p>

    <div id="SunCard" class="info-card">
        <h3>The Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with
            internal
            convective motion that generates a magnetic field.</p>

        <p>The Sun is the primary source of light and heat for life on Earth, and it is responsible for driving the
            Earth's
            climate and weather patterns.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: The Sun's magnetic field undergoes a complete reversal approximately every 11 years, known as the
            solar
            cycle.</p>
